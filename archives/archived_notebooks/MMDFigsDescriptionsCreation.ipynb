The main topic of this figure is to depict the spatial relationships and dimensions of these specific areas on the insect's head. The malar area is highlighted as the shortest distance from the eye to the mandible, emphasizing its significance in anatomical studies and identification processes. This area is crucial for understanding feeding mechanisms and articulation of the mandible. The genal area, located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge, is also detailed, showing its relative position and importance in protecting the insect's head and supporting eye structures. The diagram serves as a critical reference for entomologists and researchers studying insect morphology, providing clear visual definitions of these key areas, which are essential for taxonomic and functional analyses.\",\n",
