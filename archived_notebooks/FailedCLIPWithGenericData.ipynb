        "Note for those in Github: This notebook contains a failed attempt at using CLIP Embeddings for multimodal retrieval. It fails because our image data at this point is super niche (simple diagrams of specific bee parts), so, CLIP doesn't know what to do with it. The biggest symptom of it not working is that the retrieval is super biased towards text embeddings (it won't retrieve image embeddings, no matter the query), probably because the image embeddings were generated poorly. SO, this notebook is mainly just here for the sake of bookkeeping. However, if we get more generic image data, this notebook may be good a resource. Also, be weary of the tests at the end, they were written half heartedly after we knew that CLIP was a sinking ship.\n",
